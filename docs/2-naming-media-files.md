# Naming Media Files

When adding media files to AnyStream, it will attempt to identify and download metadata for each piece of content. This
process works by parsing folder and file names to identify Movies, TV Shows, Episodes, etc. AnyStream attempts to
support the most common naming conventions for importing.

## Movies

## TV Shows

## Subtitle Files
